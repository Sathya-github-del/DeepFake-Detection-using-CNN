# DeepFake-Detection-using-CNN

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on detecting deepfake images and videos using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Deepfakes are AI-generated media that can manipulate visual and auditory content to depict events that never happened, raising concerns about misinformation and privacy.

Key Features:
CNN Architecture: Utilizes state-of-the-art CNN models tailored for deepfake detection, such as ResNet, VGG, or custom architectures.
Dataset: Includes curated datasets of both real and deepfake images/videos for training and evaluation.
Preprocessing: Implements preprocessing techniques specific to deepfake detection, such as face detection, alignment, and augmentation.
Training Pipeline: Scripts and notebooks for training the CNN models on GPU-enabled hardware, optimizing performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Tools for evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Guidelines or scripts for deploying trained models to detect deepfakes in real-time or batch processing scenarios.
Usage:
Dataset Preparation: Download and preprocess datasets using provided scripts.
Model Training: Train CNN models using notebooks or scripts provided, leveraging GPU for faster training.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using included evaluation scripts and metrics.
Deployment: Deploy trained models in your application for real-time deepfake detection.
Contributions:
Contributions and enhancements are welcome! Whether you're improving the CNN architecture, adding new datasets, or optimizing preprocessing steps, your contributions can help advance deepfake detection technology.
