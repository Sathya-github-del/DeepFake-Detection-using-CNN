## Overview

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on **detecting deepfake images and videos** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Deepfakes are AI-generated media that manipulate visual and auditory content, posing challenges related to misinformation and privacy.

## Key Features

### CNN Architecture

- Utilizes state-of-the-art **CNN models** tailored for deepfake detection, such as ResNet, VGG, or custom architectures.

### Dataset

- Includes curated datasets of both **real and deepfake images/videos** for training and evaluation.

### Preprocessing

- Implements preprocessing techniques specific to deepfake detection:
  - **Face detection** and alignment.
  - **Data augmentation** to enhance model robustness.

### Training Pipeline

- Provides scripts and notebooks for **training CNN models** on GPU-enabled hardware, optimizing performance.
